# SweetDream App
## This is an android appliaction developped for parents. 
When telling bedtime stories, parents may fall asleep faster than their children do. With this app, parents can record their own voices and the app could play the records. If they want to read themselves, they can set up a time after which if there is no action detected on the screen, the clock would ring and remind the parents so that they can continue reading or take actions.
